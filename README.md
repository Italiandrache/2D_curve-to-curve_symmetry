# 2D_curve-to-curve_symmetry
Python code to find the symmetry of a given curve with respect to any other differentiable curve in a 2D plane, regarding the latter as an axis of reflection.

Based upon an idea I had in 2015, it's a very slow code since it uses sympy to compute all the math, so multiprocessing is recommended.
